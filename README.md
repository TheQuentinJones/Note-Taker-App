  One will navigate to the url where the application is deployed. If they need to store a note then they will enter a title and a text body for that note and click the save button. The item will then save. Once saved, one can revisit that note by clicking on it's title in the left hand column. Once this note has served its purpose, one can delete this note by clicking the trashcan icon next to the note title. You can repeat these steps for all notes.
